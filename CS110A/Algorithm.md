Stepwise refinement process:

Grab tea preparation equipments: 
a. Open the cupboard
b. Grab a kettle, cup, tea bag and a spoon 
c. Place the equipmets we just grabbed on the kitchen counter 
d. Close the cupboard 
e. Open the fridge 
f. Grab the bottle of milk and place it in the counter 
g. close the fridge

Fill the Kettle: 
a. Take the kettle that was placed in the counter 
b. Place it under the tap on the sink 
c. Open the tap 
d. Fill the kettle halfway through 
e. Close the tap

Boil the Kettle: 
a. Take the kettle and plug it to the outlet 
b. Turn the kettle on 
c. Wait for the water inside the kettle to boil 
d. Remove the Kettle from the outlet

Pour the water: 
a. Take the cup from the counter and place it on the table 
b. Pour the boiled water from the kettle half way through inside the cup 
c. Place the kettle aside on the table so others can make tea for themselves

Position the tea bag on the cup: 
a. Take the tea bag from the counter 
b. Position it on the cup in such a way that only half of the tea bag gets immersed

Add milk: 
a. Take the milk from the counter 
b. open the lid 
c. Pour the required amount inside the cup 
d. close the lid and put it aside

Dink: 
a. dink the tea bag in and pull it up 
b. repeat the process until you reach the desired color of the tea

Cleanup after yourself: 
a. Place the milk inside the fridge and other eqipments that are no longer required at their respective places.
